# Chess Game - Advanced Features

## Overview
The Mini Chess game in the Fun Zone section now includes professional chess rules including **en passant**, **check**, **checkmate**, and **stalemate** detection. Players can choose between **1-Player** (vs Computer) or **2-Player** (vs Friend) modes with a complete scoring system that tracks captured pieces.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Game Modes

#### 1-Player Mode (vs Computer)
- Player controls white pieces (bottom)
- Computer controls black pieces (top) with random valid moves
- Player labeled as "You" with white king icon (â™”)
- Computer labeled as "Computer" with black king icon (â™š)

#### 2-Player Mode (vs Friend)
- Two players take turns on the same device
- White player goes first (bottom)
- Black player goes second (top)
- Turn-based gameplay with automatic turn switching
- Players labeled as "White" and "Black"

### 2. Scoring System

**Piece Values:**
- Pawn: 1 point
- Knight: 3 points
- Bishop: 3 points
- Rook: 5 points
- Queen: 9 points
- King: Not capturable (game ends in checkmate)

**Display:**
- Points shown next to each player's name
- Real-time score updates when pieces are captured
- Includes en passant captures (pawn value = 1)

### 3. Player Information

**Layout (Chess.com style):**
- **Top Left:** Computer/Black player with king icon and score
- **Bottom Left:** You/White player with king icon and score
- Each player display shows:
  - Player icon (â™š for black, â™” for white)
  - Player name (Computer/You or Black/White)
  - Current points from captured pieces

### 4. En Passant Capture
**What it is:** A special pawn capture that can only occur under specific conditions.

**When it happens:**
- A pawn moves 2 squares forward from its starting position
- An enemy pawn is on an adjacent file on the same rank
- On the very next move, the enemy pawn can capture "in passing" (en passant)

**Example:**
```
1. White pawn moves from row 6 to row 4 (2 squares)
2. Black pawn is on row 4, adjacent column
3. Black pawn can capture diagonally to row 5, removing white pawn
```

### 5. Check Detection
**What it is:** When a king is under direct attack by an enemy piece.

**Behavior:**
- Player receives message: "Check! Your turn" or "Check! Computer is thinking..."
- King must move out of check or block the attack
- Cannot make moves that leave your own king in check

### 6. Checkmate
**What it is:** King is in check AND has no legal moves to escape.

**Game Over Conditions:**
- Player wins: "Checkmate! You win! ðŸŽ‰"
- Computer wins: "Checkmate! Computer wins!"
- Board becomes locked after checkmate

### 7. Stalemate (Draw)
**What it is:** Player has no legal moves BUT king is NOT in check.

**Result:**
- Game ends in a draw
- Message: "Stalemate! It's a draw."
- Neither player wins

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
- chessBoard: 8x8 array representing the board
- selectedSquare: Currently selected piece position
- chessMessage: Game status and turn information
- lastMove: Tracks previous move for en passant validation
- gameOver: Prevents moves after checkmate/stalemate
- chessMode: '1-player' or '2-player' mode selection
- whiteScore: Points accumulated by white player
- blackScore: Points accumulated by black player
- currentTurn: 'white' or 'black' (for 2-player mode)
```
