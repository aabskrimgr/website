## 📋 NEXT STEPS - You Need To Do This:

### 1. Create FREE Pusher Account (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://pusher.com/
2. Click **"Sign Up"** (it's FREE - no credit card needed!)
3. After login, click **"Create App"** or go to **Channels** → **"Create App"**
4. Fill in:
   - **App Name:** Portfolio Chess (or whatever)
   - **Cluster:** Choose closest to you:
     - `us2` - US East
     - `us3` - US West
     - `eu` - Europe
     - `ap1` - Asia Pacific
   - **Tech Stack:** React
5. Click **"Create App"**

### 2. Get Your Keys

After creating the app, go to **"App Keys"** tab and copy:
- ✅ `app_id`
- ✅ `key` (this is your public key)
- ✅ `secret` (keep this private!)
- ✅ `cluster` (e.g., us2, eu, ap1)

### 3. Add to Netlify Environment Variables

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Select your site
3. Go to: **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
4. Click **"Add a variable"** for each of these:

```
PUSHER_APP_ID=paste_your_app_id
PUSHER_KEY=paste_your_key
PUSHER_SECRET=paste_your_secret
PUSHER_CLUSTER=paste_your_cluster
```

**IMPORTANT:** After adding env variables, go to **Deploys** → **Trigger deploy** → **Clear cache and deploy site**

### 4. Create Local .env File (Optional - for local testing)

Create `portfolio-react/.env` (copy from `.env.example`):

```env
VITE_PUSHER_KEY=your_key_here
VITE_PUSHER_CLUSTER=us2

PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
PUSHER_KEY=your_key_here
PUSHER_SECRET=your_secret_here
PUSHER_CLUSTER=us2
```

**NOTE:** Never commit `.env` file - it's already in `.gitignore`

## 🎯 How To Test:

1. After setting up Pusher and deploying:
2. Open your site: https://aabiskarregmi.com.np/#fun-zone
