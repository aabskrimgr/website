# Netlify Blobs Setup Guide

## Automatic Setup (Recommended)

Netlify Blobs is **automatically available** for all sites on Netlify! No manual configuration needed.

## What Happens When You Deploy

1. **Netlify detects the function** (`visitor-count.js`)
2. **Blobs storage is auto-enabled** for your site
3. **Environment variables are injected** automatically:
   - `NETLIFY_BLOB_TOKEN`
   - `SITE_ID`

## First Deploy

When your site deploys for the first time with this code:

1. The visitor counter starts at **0**
2. First visitor increments it to **1**
3. Each unique visitor adds to the count
4. Count persists forever (stored in Netlify Blobs)

## Verify It's Working

After deployment, test the function:

```bash
# Get current count
curl https://aabiskarregmi.com.np/.netlify/functions/visitor-count

# Should return:
# {"count": X}
```

## View Netlify Blobs Dashboard

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Select your site: **aabiskarregmi-com-np**
3. Click **"Blobs"** in the left sidebar
4. You'll see your stored data:
   - `visitor-count` - The current count
   - `unique-visitors` - List of visitor fingerprints

## Pricing

- **Free Tier**: 
  - 1 GB storage
  - 100 GB bandwidth/month
  - Unlimited reads/writes

Your visitor counter uses **~1-2 KB** total, so you're well within limits!

## Reset Count (If Needed)

If you ever need to reset the counter:

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard â†’ Your Site â†’ Blobs
2. Delete the `visitor-count` blob
3. Delete the `unique-visitors` blob
4. Next visitor will start count at 1

Or use the Netlify CLI:
```bash
netlify blobs:delete visitor-count --store production
netlify blobs:delete unique-visitors --store production
```

## Monitoring

Check your Netlify Function logs:
1. Netlify Dashboard â†’ Your Site â†’ Functions
2. Click on `visitor-count`
3. View logs to see requests

## Troubleshooting

### Function not appearing?
- Check `netlify.toml` has correct functions directory
- Redeploy the site

### Count not increasing?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify function URL in Network tab
- Check Netlify function logs

### Count reset to 0?
- Blobs were deleted
- Check Netlify Blobs dashboard

## Success Indicators

âœ… Function appears in Netlify Functions dashboard
âœ… Blobs appear in Netlify Blobs dashboard  
âœ… Count increases with new visitors
âœ… Returning visitors (same day) don't increase count
âœ… Count persists across deployments
âœ… All browsers show same count

## No Action Required!

Just deploy and it works automatically! ðŸŽ‰
